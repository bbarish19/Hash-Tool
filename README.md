# Hash-Tool

The File Hash Generator is a Python application that allows users to calculate and display hash values for a selected file. It computes three types of hash algorithms:

1. MD5

2. SHA-1

3. SHA-256

The program also provides the option to copy each hash value to the clipboard and displays them in a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter.


Features

1. Choose a file and calculate its hash values (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256).

2. Display the calculated hashes in a user-friendly interface.

3. Option to copy any of the hash values to the clipboard.

4. Clear the displayed hash values with the "Clear Hashes" button.

5. Access the End User License Agreement (EULA) through a dedicated button.


Installation

Step 1: Install Python

  If you haven't installed Python already, download and install it from the official Python website.

Step 2: Install Dependencies

  The required libraries come pre-installed with Python. You do not need to install additional packages if you have Python 3.x installed.

Step 3: Running the Application

  Clone or Download the Repository:

  If you're using a version control system like Git:

  git clone https://your-repository-link.git

  cd your-repository

Alternatively, download the source code as a .exe and run it

Run the Script:

  Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, and run:

  python file_hash_generator.py

The application window will appear, and you can begin selecting files to generate hash values.


Usage

Select File:

Click the "Choose File" button to select a file from your computer.
View Hashes:

The MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 hash values for the selected file will be displayed.
Copy Hash:

To copy a hash to the clipboard, click the "Copy" button under the corresponding hash.
Clear Hashes:

Use the "Clear Hashes" button to remove all displayed hash values.
EULA:

The "EULA" button opens a window with the End User License Agreement (EULA).
